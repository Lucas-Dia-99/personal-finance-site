  <h2>How we calculate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Owning net cost:</strong> cumulative outflows − equity (minus selling fees at exit).</li>
    <li><strong>Renting net cost:</strong> rent + renter’s insurance, inflated annually.</li>
    <li>Principal reduces balance (not a cost); interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance, HOA are costs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>When to use this</h2>
  <p>Use for first-home decisions, move vs. stay comparisons, or to gauge how rate and price shifts affect the breakeven year.</p>

  <h2>FAQs</h2>
  <details><summary>How is down payment treated?</summary>As an opportunity cost—you could invest it at your chosen alternative return instead.</details>
  <details><summary>Do you include tax deductions?</summary>Not yet; we keep the core comparison clean. You can add a manual adjustment in your analysis if needed.</details>
